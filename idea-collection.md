Enter your name: [Prompt user to input name] "Bob" -- for the purpose of this it's all bob but it should be whatever the user inputs 

Prelogue:

Bob is bored of his corporate life, so he buys a house in the country. He walks through the door and immeditaly knows its haunted.
In his moment of realization, the ghosts trapped him in his bathroom. They make a deal with him: If he's smart enough to beat their games, they'll let him go.  

Game Begins:

Bob looks up at the mirror covered in dirt, and notices something(or someone) is writing in it. He opens the vanity and finds a paper and a pen.

Are you going to 
1. Try to copy down the words
2. Use the pen to pick the lock

        if they choose 1: Typing Tutor Game
        if they choose 2: They open the door but the door opens to the edge of a cliff. Bob has to go back inside 
        

Once Typing Tutor is Finished:

The door creaks open, now Bob enters the living room. It's pitchblack //ASCII of house map 

    Ligthbulb part that Lea wanted to add
    
Ah yes! The light is back on, he sees a rocking chair and the Queen of England sitting on it. 

What will you say?
1. "oy Im bri'ish too!"
2. "USA USA USA!"

  What if you say "oy Im bri'ish too!" the ghost or queen or whatver takes the pen away... and at the end, at the final question if Bob can't solve it he can still escape if he picks a lock with his pen, but that depends on what you said here. Basically Bob beocme a ghost if he can't solve it, if he can't solve it but has the pen he can pick a lock with it and escape, and if he solves it he is free to go whatever he said at this point.
  
    Either way Bob has to play tic-tac-toe with her
   
        Tic Tac Toe game

If he loses, he dies
If he wins, he moves onto the final room.

Epilogue:
The spirits announce themselves: "You have outwitted us, which would make you too smart to spend your life haunting people; you're free to go." Bob exits outside with a fresh new idea: what if a group of people paid a bunch of money to do what I just did; Bob's Escape Room! 

THE END
