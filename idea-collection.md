Prelogue:

Bob is bored of his corporate life, so he buys a house in the country. He walks through the door and immeditaly knows its haunted.

Epilogue:
The spirits announce themselves: "You have outwitted us, which would make you too smart to spend your life haunting people; you're free to go." Bob exits outside with a fresh new idea: what if a group of people paid a bunch of money to do what I just did; Bob's Escape Room!
